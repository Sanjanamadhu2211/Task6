# Task6
In this task, I implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification on the Iris dataset. I normalized features, split data into training/testing sets, experimented with different values of K, and evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. I also visualized decision boundaries using the first two features.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn -> for plotting and visualization
- Scikit-learn -> for KNN, preprocessing, and evaluation
